# Introduction to Protocols

This project introduces the concept of protocols and their significance in communication, particularly within microservices architecture. Common protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP are discussed, emphasizing their roles in server-client communication.

## Server-to-Server Communication

The focus shifts to server-to-server (S2S) communication, highlighting its importance in microservices. Microservices need to communicate internally, and this project provides examples of API services and data services to illustrate this necessity.

## Challenges with Existing Protocols

Using HTTP for internal communication can introduce overhead due to unnecessary headers and security features. Additionally, the concept of coupling is introduced, where services become dependent on each other, complicating communication.

## Communication Strategies

Two main strategies for communication are discussed:

- **Synchronous Communication**: Requires immediate responses.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Allows for decoupled interactions, often using a queue system.

## Building a Custom Protocol

This project proposes creating a lightweight TCP protocol to reduce overhead and improve efficiency in microservices communication. The process of coding a simple server and client is demonstrated, focusing on establishing connections and sending data.

## Introduction to gRPC

The project also discusses gRPC, a high-performance framework for remote procedure calls that operates over HTTP/2 and uses protocol buffers for efficient communication. gRPC is presented as a solution to the overhead issues associated with HTTP, particularly for synchronous server-to-server communication.

## Conclusion

The project concludes by encouraging viewers to implement their own lightweight TCP protocol, emphasizing the need for efficient communication in backend architectures. Viewers are invited to share their implementations and engage with the content.
